## Intro

This app has been made to introduce people to Kotlin and make something fancy in the process.

## Before we start

To be able to edit and run this app, you need [Android Studio 3.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) or higher, since that version comes with Kotlin included out of box.

After installing, choose **Check out project from Version Control** -> **Git** and put as **Git Repository URL**: https://github.com/CesarChretien/KotlinMeetupApp

Run the project and happy hacking!

## In the future

This project will be a well-documented, easy-to-follow tutorial to build a chat app from scratch in Kotlin.
