## Intro
This app has been made to introduce people to Kotlin in Android development and make something fancy in the process.

## Before we start
To be able to edit and run this app, you need [Android Studio 3.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) or higher, since that version comes with Kotlin included out of box.

After installing, choose **Check out project from Version Control** -> **Git** and put as **Git Repository URL**: https://github.com/CesarChretien/KotlinMeetupApp

## This is the master branch
This branch contains the completed project. If you're in a rush, out of time or need to save the world but you *really* want to see the final product, just run the project by running it. :) Otherwise you can check out [step-1](https://github.com/CesarChretien/KotlinMeetupApp/tree/step-1) by typing the following in your Terminal:

`git checkout step-1`

## What do we do?
In every step there will be some `TODO("<description>")` blocks in the code for you to fill in. What to do in each step can be found in the corresponding `README.md`s. Asking questions is encouraged!
