## Intro

This app has been made to introduce people to Kotlin and make something fancy in the process.

## Before we start

To be able to edit and run this app, you need [Android Studio 3.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) or higher, since that version comes with Kotlin included out of box.

After installing, choose **Check out project from Version Control** -> **Git** and put as **Git Repository URL**: https://github.com/CesarChretien/KotlinMeetupApp

Run the project and happy hacking!

## This is the master branch

This branch contains the completed project. If you're in a rush, out of time or need to save the world but you *really* want to see the final product, check out this branch and run it. :)
