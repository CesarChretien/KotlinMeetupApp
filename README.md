## Intro

This app has been made to introduce people to Kotlin and make something fancy in the process.

## Before we start

To be able to edit and run this app, you need [Android Studio 3.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) or higher, since that version comes with Kotlin included out of box.

After installing, choose **Check out project from Version Control** -> **Git** and put as **Git Repository URL**: https://github.com/CesarChretien/KotlinMeetupApp

Run the project and happy hacking!

# Step 1

## Introduction

Sadly, nothing fancy is going to happen here. This branch is the bare-bones project but with a all the dependencies in the `build.gradle` and `AndroidManifest.xml` files so you don't have to worry about those. Getting the setup of those files done correctly is an important part of Android development, but not something we want to both you with during this project. :) If you're interested you can look into them (and don't be shy to ask questions either)!

## Getting to run the app.

In Android Studio, press the green triangle located somewhere on top or press **CTRL** + **R**. You'll be prompted with a **Select Deployment Target** window where you can select on which device you want to run your app. You can choose to either run it on a physical device or a virtual device (also called an emulator). Go to "Run the app on your physical device" if you have an Android phone you can connect to your computer *and* you want to run the app on that phone, otherwise go to "Run the app on an emulator".
